# Readme

As a beginner in the field of Battery Management System (BMS), I find few open source code and related resources for me to follow. I made this repository for mainly two reasons.

The first reason is that I want to back up all the paper I read and the slides made for weekly meeting.

The second reason is that I hope to help someone else who are interest in this field. 

I will try my best to make my code readable and classify the related Paper of battery conditions into right categories.

There also contain a GUI for Battery Management System.

Especially, thanks to my instructors Pro.Ma, Reza and friend Zhuowei.
